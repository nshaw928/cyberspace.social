## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
cd backend/django-project
./run_migrations.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations profiles posts friendships
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Create Superuser
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 3. Start Django Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 4. Test Endpoints
- Profiles: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/profile/me
- Posts Feed: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/posts/feed
- Friends: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/friends

## 🔍 Key Implementation Details

### Profile Pictures
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL database (BinaryField)
- **Format:** Base64 encoded for API responses
- **Max Size:** 500KB
- **Upload:** POST to `/api/profile/picture` with multipart/form-data

### Post Images
- **Storage:** Filesystem (`backend/django-project/media/`)
- **Format:** JPEG stored with unique filename (userid_timestamp.jpg)
- **Max Size:** 2MB
- **Client-side:** Already compressed to 1080x1080px @ 85% quality

### Feed Algorithm
- Query all accepted friendships for current user
- Get friend user IDs
- Filter posts by friend IDs
- Order by created_at DESC
- Paginate 10 per page
- Uses `select_related()` for performance

### Friendship Normalization
- Always store user1.id < user2.id
- Ensures single friendship record per pair
- Prevents duplicate friendships
- Simplifies queries

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Email verification not yet implemented** - Users can login immediately after registration
2. **Password reset not yet implemented** - Will need email service integration
3. **SQLite still in use** - Migration to PostgreSQL recommended for production
4. **No image optimization on server** - Relies on client-side compression
5. **No rate limiting middleware** - Only post creation rate limited

## 📝 Frontend API Integration Notes

### Current Frontend Endpoints vs Backend
All frontend API calls now have matching backend endpoints:

| Frontend Call | Backend Endpoint | Status |
|---------------|------------------|--------|
| POST /account/token | ✅ Implemented | Working |
| POST /account/authenticated | ✅ Implemented | Working |
| POST /account/logout | ✅ Implemented | Working |
| GET /api/profile/me | ✅ Implemented | Ready |
| PUT /api/profile/me | ✅ Implemented | Ready |
| GET /api/posts/feed | ✅ Implemented | Ready |
| POST /api/posts | ✅ Implemented | Ready |
| POST /api/posts/:id/comments | ✅ Implemented | Ready |
| POST /api/friends/search | ✅ Implemented | Ready |

### Frontend Updates Needed
1. Update API base URL paths (profile → api/profile)
2. Test image upload with FormData
3. Test pagination with hasMore flag
4. Test comment visibility filtering
5. Test friend request workflow
